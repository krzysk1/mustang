 Some features may not work as intended and this aircraft could crash your Aerofly FS4. 
 Use it at your own risk!

Note: this model does not have a detailed cockpit. It is a simple conversion of the previous model from AFS1 and AFS2, and no further development is planned at this time. 
If you are interested you can begin to develop the model on your own (I will provide any assistance in this regard)
